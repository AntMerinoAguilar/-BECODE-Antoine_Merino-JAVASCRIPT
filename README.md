# JavaScript Exercises at BeCode ðŸ’»

Welcome to this repository, which contains my exercises completed as part of the BeCode training program, focusing on learning **JavaScript**. This repository includes:

- Theoretical notes.
- Practical exercises.
- Advanced algorithms.

## Repository Structure ðŸ“‚

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to training weeks:

- `WEEK-01b-02/`: Introduction to JavaScript, covering the basics such as variables, functions, and control structures.
- `WEEK-03-04/`: Advanced algorithm exercises covering everything already learned.

## Topics Covered ðŸ“š

- **JavaScript Basics**: Syntax, data types, operators.
- **Functions**: Declaration, expressions, arrow functions.
- **Control Structures**: Loops, conditionals.
- **Arrays**: Array methods, array manipulation.
- **Objects**: Object properties and methods.
- **Algorithms**: Problem-solving with JavaScript.

## How to Use This Repository ðŸš€

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntMerinoAguilar/-BECODE-Antoine_Merino-JAVASCRIPT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd -BECODE-Antoine_Merino-JAVASCRIPT
   ```

3. **Open the JavaScript files** in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

4. **Run the exercises** in the browser's developer console or using Node.js to check the results and verify the solutions.

## Key Learnings ðŸš€

This project helped me solidify the following concepts:

- **Basic JavaScript Syntax**: Working with variables, data types, and operators.
- **Control Flow**: Using conditionals, loops, and logical operators.
- **Functions**: Understanding function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- **Data Structures**: Manipulating arrays and objects.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Writing code to solve complex problems step by step.
